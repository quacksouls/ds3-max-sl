# Routes

What follows is a route for any% speedrun. This route allows you to finish the
game by defeating as few bosses as possible, meaning that your primary means of
levelling up is with Yeol. You must defeat 13 bosses along this route, which
gives you at least 4.8 million souls provided that you solo all the bosses.

Extra souls can be obtained by doing an all bosses speedrun. An all bosses
speedrun should provide you with enough souls to level up once, twice, or even
three times in addition to the 5 levels you obtain from Yoel. The remaining 12
optional bosses together give you 6,734,950 souls assuming that you solo all
these bosses. An all bosses speedrun would therefore net you at least 11,575,652
souls.

Next to each boss is the maximum amount of souls you would obtain after their
defeat provided you were fighting the boss solo, equipped all the soul-boosting
items, and you were fighting the boss in at least NG+7. The more phantoms you
summon for a boss fight, the less souls you would obtain.
