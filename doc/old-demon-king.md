# Optional: Old Demon King

Maximum souls: 278,842

All demon bosses are weak against dark damage. These include the Old Demon King,
the Stray Demon atop Farron Keep, the Demon who guards the entrance to
Smouldering Lake, and the Demon in the Undead Settlement. The Demon in Pain and
Demon from Below are both weak against dark, but the Demon Prince is resilient
against this elemental damage.

Equip the Court Sorcerer's Staff+10 (or Murky Longstaff+10) in the left hand and
equip the Scholar's Candlestick+0 in the right hand. Equip these to boost your
damage output: Blindfold Mask, Dark Clutch Ring, Young Dragon Ring, Bellowing
Dragoncrest Ring. The 4th ring can be either Chloranthy Ring+3 or Lloyd's Sword
Ring. Use the weapon art of the staff to buff it and cast Affinity. Cast Great
Soul Dregs as your primary offensive weapon. The video below demonstrates the
dark sorcery strategy.

If you defeated Tsorig while he invaded you at the Catacombs of Carthus, you
have the choice to summon him for this fight. You can summon Cuculus as well.
