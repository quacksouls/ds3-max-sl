Maximum souls: 520,506

This boss is another gimmick fight, the gimmick being that you can perform a
plunging attack to kill the boss in one fell swoop. The most difficult part is
running past the hordes of Man-serpents on your way to the platform that allows
you to perform the plunging attack. Follow the route as shown in the video
below, casting Hidden Body as necessary.

For those who are not comfortable with running past enemy hordes, the following
video shows one way to cheese the fight. Stand at a corner, remove all your
weapons and armour pieces, equip the Symbol of Avarice and these rings: Red
Tearstone Ring, Flynn's Ring, Morne's Ring, Ring of the Sun's First Born. Use
the weapon art of Bloodlust to bring your HP bar down to the amount that
triggers the effect of the Red Tearstone Ring. Now remove the Symbol of Avarice,
equip the Morion Blade in the right hand and Yorshka's Chime+10 in the left
hand. Cast Sacred Oath and Deep Protection, lock onto the boss, and cast Great
Lightning Spear.
