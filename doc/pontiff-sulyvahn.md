Maximum souls: 312,303

This boss is weak against parry and lightning. His very first attack can always
be parried and after that most of his attacks during the fight can also be
parried. If you are not comfortable with parrying Pontiff Sulyvahn, at least
learn to parry the very first attack for an easy riposte. Refer to the video
guide below for how to parry Pontiff Sulyvahn:

Here are some strategies to fight Pontiff Sulyvahn, assuming that you first cast
Sacred Oath or use the weapon art of the Sunlight Straight Sword, and cast Deep
Protection:

1. Equip the Lothric Knight Greatsword+10 in the right hand. The left hand
   should be equipped with a Blessed infused Caestus+10 and the Sunless
   Talisman+5. Equip these rings to boost your damage output: Lightning Clutch
   Ring, Lloyd's Sword Ring. Equip Havel's Ring+3 to maintain your weight ratio
   below 30%. The fourth ring slot is recommended to be the Chloranthy Ring+3.
   Buff the Lothric Knight Greatsword+10 with Lightning Blade and switch the
   left hand to the Caestus. Run and/or walk to the boss and parry his very
   first attack follow by a riposte. Two-hand your main weapon and look for
   opportunities to R1 the boss. See the following video for the strategy.

1. Similar to the previous strategy. Equip the Lothric Knight Greatsword+10 in
   the right hand. The left hand should be equipped with a Blessed infused
   Caestus+10. Use Yorshka's Chime+10 to buff the sword with Lightning Blade.
   Equip these rings for extra damage output: Lightning Clutch Ring, Lloyd's
   Sword Ring. The remaining 2 rings can be any you want. The Chloranthy Ring+3
   is recommended if you want a boost to your stamina regeneration. Ring of
   Steel Protection+3 is recommended to help you tank one or two hits. Consume a
   Red Bug Pellet for some extra fire defense. Use the Caestus to parry the
   boss' very first attack, followed by a riposte. Now 2-hand your weapon for a
   fully charged R2. As the boss sits down to charge an AOE, quickly back away,
   wait for the AOE to finish, and run in for an R1. While the boss is summoning
   a clone of himself, perform a fully charged R2, followed by another fully
   charged R2 to kill the clone. Ensure you time the first fully charged R2 to
   hit the clone. Now wait for opportunities to finish off the boss. The above
   strategy is demonstrated in the following video.

1. Attune Chaos Bed Vestiges and equip these rings to boost your pyromancy:
   Witch's Ring, Great Swamp Ring, Lloyd's Sword Ring. The fourth ring slot is
   up to you to decide. Equip a Caestus in the left hand and a Chaos infused
   Lothric Knight Sword+10 in the right hand. Enter the fog wall and sprint to
   the small flight of stairs in front of Pontiff Sulyvahn. Parry the very first
   attack of the boss and follow up with a riposte. Now switch to Chaos Bed
   Vestiges to finish off the boss.
1. Use the above strategy together with summoning an NPC phantom to distract the
   boss while you're spamming Vestiges in the boss' face. There are at least 2
   signs in front of the fog wall for summoning NPC phantoms to help you
   distract the boss. One is Black Hand Gotthard, the other Londor Pale Shade.
   Depending on whether you have been following Anri's quest line, you can use
   the Dried Finger to also summon Anri as your third phantom. However, note
   that 1 or 2 NPC phantoms are enough to distract the boss.
