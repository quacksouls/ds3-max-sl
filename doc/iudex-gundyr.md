# Iudex Gundyr

Maximum souls: 55,768

This boss is weak against fire and lightning. Here are some strategies to fight
him, assuming that you first cast Sacred Oath or use the weapon art of the
Sunlight Straight Sword, and cast Deep Protection:

1. Buff an ultra great sword or a straight sword with Carthus Flame Arc. My
   weapon of choice is the Fume Ultra Greatsword+5, but the Lothric Knight
   Greatsword+10 is also effective. With an ultra great sword 2-handed, after
   pulling out the Coiled Sword I would do 2 R1 and strafe around to do another
   R1. Then wait for chances to R1 Gundyr to death. If you're using an ultra
   great sword, you might as well equip the Mendicant's Staff and the Shield of
   Want so you can quickly swap to them after the boss is defeated. Refer to the
   video below for the strategy.

1. Buff the Astora Straight Sword+10, Lothric Knight Sword+10, Anri's Straight
   Sword+5, or Sellsword Twinblades+10 with Carthus Flame Arc. Pull out the
   Coiled Sword and spam R1 the boss to death. In the case of the Sellsword
   Twinblades+10, 2-hand the weapon and spam L1. After pulling out the Coiled
   Sword, you should be able to output at least 4 R1, or 4 L1 in the case of the
   Twinblades, before Gundyr stands up. Also equip Lloyd's Sword Ring and Fire
   Clutch Ring for some extra damage output. Note that neither the Great Swamp
   Ring nor the Witch's Ring boost the damage from Carthus Flame Arc.
   Furthermore, consider equipping the Old Wolf Curved Sword in the left hand to
   boost your attack. The passive effect of this weapon stacks with Pontiff's
   Right Eye and Carthus Beacon. If you don't have a ring slot for Pontiff's
   Right Eye, you might as well equip the Old Wolf Curved Sword and, in
   addition, cast Carthus Beacon. Note that Carthus Beacon does not stack with
   Deep Protection. The following video demonstrates the strategy using the
   Sellsword Twinblades.

1. Attune Chaos Bed Vestiges. Equip a Pyromancy Flame+10, Witch's Ring, Great
   Swamp Ring, Lloyd's Sword Ring, Fire Clutch Ring, and roast the boss with
   Vestiges.
1. If you have at least 60 Intelligence and 60 Faith, equip Yorshka's Chime+10
   and Sunlight Straight Sword+5. Buff your weapon with Lightning Blade and
   equip these rings to boost your damage output: Lightning Clutch Ring, Lloyd
   Sword Ring. The remaining 2 rings can be anything you want.
