Before you are allowed to fight Midir in its boss arena, you must first knock it
off the bridge near the Shared Grave bonfire. See the following video for a
strategy to help you knock Midir off the bridge.

Midir is intimidating because of its size and enormous HP pool. The boss is
easier to fight solo because it would not run/fly around the arena too much.
Furthermore, Midir is easy to read as you constantly position yourself in front
of it. Once you have fallen down the hole and landed on the boss arena, cast
Sacred Oath and Deep Protection and use Yorshka's Chime+10 to buff a
Dragonslayer's Axe+10 with Lightning Blade. Equip Lloyd's Sword Ring and/or
Lightning Clutch Ring for extra damage output. Refer to the following for
strategies on fighting Midir:

Midir is vulnerable against Pestilent Mist. Use this spell if you want.
