# Vordt

Maximum souls: 55,768

Before you enter the boss arena, make sure you first talk to Emma and receive
the Small Lothric Banner. Vordt is vulnerable to lightning, is especially weak
against dark, but pyromancy can make quick work of him. Here are some strategies
to fight him, assuming that you first cast Sacred Oath or use the weapon art of
the Sunlight Straight Sword, and cast Deep Protection:

1. Two-hand the Dragonslayer's Greataxe+5, be at his rear, and R1 him. When he
   starts roaring to enter his second phase, perform the weapon art on him. If
   you're quick, you can complete 2 rounds of weapon arts. After finishing
   roaring and sprinting around during this second phase, Vordt would stop to
   blow frost. Run to his side or rear and weapon art him to death. See the
   video below for the strategy.

1. Buff a +10 straight sword or the Sellsword Twinblades+10 with Lightning Blade
   and equip these rings for bonus damage output: Lloyd's Sword Ring, Lightning
   Clutch Ring. If you plan on spamming R1, or 2-handed L1 in the case of the
   Sellsword Twinblades+10, equip the Old Wolf Curved Sword in the left hand and
   cast Carthus Beacon. Note that Deep Protection and Carthus Beacon do not
   stack with each other; casting one would cancel the other. As the Old Wolf
   Curved Sword might increase your weight ratio above 30%, consider whether
   Pontiff's Right Eye works for you instead. Unless you can defeat Vordt
   without taking any damage, consider the option of stacking the bonus damage
   output from the Old Wolf Curved Sword, Pontiff's Right Eye, Lightning Clutch
   Ring, Sacred Oath, and Deep Protection.
1. Use Yorshka's Chime+10 to buff a Dragonslayer's Axe+10 with Lightning Blade.
   Equip these rings for bonus damage output: Lightning Clutch Ring, Lloyd's
   Sword Ring. The other 2 rings can be any of your choosing. Refer to the
   following video for the strategy.

1. Attune Chaos Bed Vestiges. Equip a Pyromancy Flame+10, Witch's Ring, Great
   Swamp Ring, Lloyd's Sword Ring, Fire Clutch Ring, and throw Vestiges to
   barbecue the boss.
1. Combine any of the above strategies with NPC summons. Lion Knight Albert is
   available to be summoned for the fight, but you must first defeat Sword
   Master near Firelink Shrine in order for his summon sign to appear.
