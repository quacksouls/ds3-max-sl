# Aldrich

Maximum souls: 557,685

Aldrich is vulnerable to fire. Here are some strategies to deal with him,
assuming that you first cast Sacred Oath or use the weapon art of the Sunlight
Straight Sword before entering the fog wall. In each of these strategies, equip
the Magic Stoneplate Ring+2, cast Great Magic Barrier, and consume a Blue Bug
Pellet. If you cast Deep Protection, then casting (Great) Magic Barrier would
nullify the effect of Deep Protection. In the boss arena, notice the 2 rows of
giant pillars. When Aldrich starts to teleport away, stand near a pillar. This
should not be a middle pillar, but an end-most pillar, which is a pillar at
either end of a row of pillars. Aldrich would re-emerge near the end-most pillar
diagonally opposite to where you're standing.

1. Attune Chaos Bed Vestiges and equip these rings to boost your pyromancy:
   Witch's Ring, Great Swamp Ring. Throw Vestiges at the boss. Boost your magic
   defense by casting Great Magic Barrier, equipping the Magic Stoneplate
   Ring+2, and consuming a Blue Bug Pellet. Refer to the following video for the
   pyromancy strategy.

1. Equip a Blessed infused Caestus+10 in the left hand and a Chaos infused
   Lothric Knight Sword+10 in the right hand. If you want further HP
   regeneration during the fight, equip the Sun Princess Ring. Spam R1 at the
   boss. During the second phase, Aldrich would summon a field of fire around
   him. If you want, equip the Flame Stoneplate Ring+2 to boost your fire damage
   absorption.
1. Equip a Sellsword Twinblades+10 in the right hand or a Chaos infused Lothric
   Knight Sword+10. In the left hand, equip these: Old Wolf Curved Sword, a
   talisman for casting Vow of Silence, Pyromancy Flame+10. Cast Sacred Oath,
   Deep Protection, and buff your weapon with Carthus Flame Arc. Enter the fog
   wall and run to Aldrich, casting Vow of Silence when you're close enough for
   the spell to also affect the boss. In your left hand, switch to the Old Wolf
   Curved Sword, 2-hand the Sellsword Twinblades+10, and start spamming L1. When
   Adrich teleports away, look for where the boss would be, run to the location,
   cast Vow of Silence, switch to Old Wolf Curved Sword, 2-hand Sellsword
   Twinblades+10, and continue spamming L1. Note that having 3 items equipped in
   the left hand might be confusing and/or mess up your focus when switching
   between the Old Wolf Curved Sword and the talisman for casting Vow of
   Silence. Before entering the fog wall, buff your weapon with Carthus Flame
   Arc and un-equip the Pyromancy Flame+10. To boost your damage output, equip
   these: Lloyd's Sword Ring, Fire Clutch Ring. Vow of Silence nullifies both
   Aldrich's and your spells. Prior to casting Vow of Silence, ensure you first
   cast (Great) Magic Barrier and quip the Magic Stoneplate Ring+2.The following
   video shows the strategy using the Lothric Knight Sword.

1. Cast Vow of Silence next to Aldrich to negate his spells and yours. Use a
   fire weapon to hit the boss.
