# Optional: Gravetender

Maximum souls: 448,290

The Gravetender and Greatwolf are weak against poison and toxic. Use the
strategy shown in the video below to cheese the 1st phase of the fight. In the
1st phase, cast Poison Mist and Toxic Mist on the 3 wolves and the Gravetender.
Once they are inflicted with poison and toxic, use the Arbalest to snipe the
gank with Exploding and/or Splintering Bolts. During the 2nd phase, you have the
choice of entering the fog wall to fight the Greatwolf or use the 2nd phase
cheese shown in video.
