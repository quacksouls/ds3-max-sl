# Undead Settlement

The 2 most important things you need to do in this area are:

1. Talk to Yoel and accept his services. Exhaust his dialogue so he would
   teleport to Firelink Shrine.
1. Light the Undead Settlement bonfire. You might need this bonfire to prepare
   for later bosses.

After you have talked to Yoel, accepted his services, and light the Undead
Settlement bonfire in the listed order, return to Firelink Shrine and level up 5
times with Yoel. Now warp back to the Undead Settlement bonfire and sprint to
the Road of Sacrifices bonfire.
