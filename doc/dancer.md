The Dancer is one of the easiest bosses to cheese. Here are some strategies to
help you fight the Dancer, assuming that you first cast Sacred Oath or use the
weapon art of the Sunlight Straight Sword, and cast Deep Protection:

1. Equip the Scholar's Candlestick in the left hand and a Court Sorcerer's
   Staff+10 in the right hand. Attune Crystal Soul Spear and equip these items
   to boost your sorcery: Crown of Dusk, Young Dragon Ring, Bellowing
   Dragoncrest Ring, Magic Clutch Ring. Two-hand the Court Sorcerer's Staff+10
   and buff the staff, then cast Crystal Soul Spear at the Dancer. Casting
   Carthus Beacon also helps to boost your damage output, but this pyromancy
   would cancel Tears of Denial.
1. Attune Chaos Bed Vestiges and equip a Pyromancy Flame+10. Equip these rings
   to boost your pyromancy: Witch's Ring, Great Swamp Ring. The other 2 ring
   slots are up to you. However, consider equipping the Chloranthy Ring+3 to
   boost your Stamina regeneration. Cast Tears of Denial if necessary and throw
   a Vestiges every now and then.
1. Equip the Sellsword Twinblades+10 in the right hand. In the left hand, equip
   the Old Wolf Curved Sword and the Sunless Talisman+5. Cast Sacred Oath and
   Deep Protection, buff the Sellsword Twinblades+10 with Lightning Blade, in
   the left hand switch to the Old Wolf Curved Sword, and 2-hand the Twinblades.
   Equip these rings for extra damage output: Lloyd's Sword Ring, Lightning
   Clutch Ring. If you need to maintain your weight ratio below 30%, consider
   using Havel's Ring+3 and/or Ring of Favor+3. Alternatively, consider
   equipping these rings: Chloranthy Ring+3, Ring of Steel Protection+3,
   Pontiff's Right Eye, Havel's Ring+3. These 4 rings should allow you to be at
   under 30% weight ratio and Pontiff's Right Eye stacks with the Old Wolf
   Curved Sword. As a safety precaution, equip Gold Pine Bundle in the slot for
   "Quick Item 2". Maintain your position at the Dancer's rear and L1 her.
1. Same as the previous strategy, but using the Warden Twinblades or Barbed
   Straight Sword. Dancer is vulnerable to bleed. Be sure to buff your weapon
   with Carthus Rouge or infuse with a Blood Gem. If you're not comfortable with
   dodging the Dancer's attacks, equip a shield having high stability,
   preferably a great shield. Stay close to the boss' side or rear, hit her once
   or twice, and block as necessary. See the following video for the strategy.

1. Don't enter the fog wall, but stand in front of it. Equip the Red Tearstone
   Ring and Flynn's Ring. Use Pestilent Mist, Symbol of Avarice, and/or
   Bloodlust to lower your HP enough to trigger the effect of the Red Tearstone
   Ring. Now equip the Morion Blade in the right hand and the Millwood
   Greatbow+5 in the left hand. Use the weapon art of the Millwood Greatbow to
   cheese Dancer from outside the fog wall. Refer to the following video for the
   cheese.
