# Optional: Oceiros

Maximum souls: 431,276

After defeating Dancer, run straight to the fog wall of Oceiros. Have Blooming
Purple Moss Clumps ready in case you get toxic. This boss is weak against
lightning and bleed. In the first phase of the fight, when Oceiros is about to
cast Pestilent Mist run behind him and hit his tail. Be careful of the boss'
rampaging charges in the second phase and the curse effect of his crystal
breath. Cast Sacred Oath and Deep Protection. Equip a Blood infused Warden
Twinblades+10 and Chloranthy Ring+3. The other 3 rings can be any of your
choosing. Two-hand your weapon, stay close to the crotch area of Oceiros, and
L1. In the 2nd phase, as Oceiros bobs down his head and curls his tail these are
cues that he is about to do a spinning attack. If you are close to Oceiros, be
prepared to roll as soon as you see these cues. The video below demonstrates the
strategy.
