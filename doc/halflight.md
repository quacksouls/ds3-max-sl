# Optional: Halflight

Maximum souls: 594,864

This is an annoying gank fight that can be cheesed by using poison and toxic. As
shown in the first video below, run to a pillar and stand there, wait for
Halflight to spawn, equip the Storyteller's Staff and use its weapon art to
poison Halflight. Once Halflight is poisoned, cast Toxic Mist. Refer to the
following videos for various cheese strategies.

Depending on far you have progressed with Lapp's questline, you can summon him
as Unbreakable Patches to help you distract one enemy while you concentrate on
the other enemy. No matter what you do, always defeat the Painting Guardian
(during both phases) as quickly as possible to prevent him from healing
Halflight.
