# Optional: Friede

Maximum souls: 535,377

The only intimidating aspect of this fight is Friede's speed in phases 1 and 3.
She is rather slow in the 2nd phase. Friede is weak against poison in all 3
phases. Father Ariandel is also weak against poison as well as bleed.

In phase 1, use a poison weapon against Friede such as Poison Throwing Knife and
a poison infused Rotten Ghru Spear+10. The Poison Throwing Knives help to keep
track of Friede whenever she becomes invisible. Once she is poisoned, the purple
mist of the poison would provide a better visual indication of her location
whenever she decides to be invisible. Poison also helps to chip down Friede's HP
bar while you look for opportunities to R1 with the 2-handed Poison Rotten Ghru
Spear+10.

In phase 2, use the weapon art of the Storyteller's Staff to poison Father
Ariandel. Once he is poisoned, use a bleed weapon to R1 him. Consider using a
blood infused Barbed Straight Sword+10 to bleed Ariandel. You can mostly ignore
Friede during this phase. However, you should keep in mind that she can heal
Ariandel. As she charges up to heal, look for a golden aura around her and
Ariandel, run to Friede and backstab her to knock her out of the healing state.

In phase 3, consider using dark sorceries as your primary weapon against Friede.
The best dark sorceries for this phase are Affinity and Great Soul Dregs.
Affinity helps you to track Friede whenever she becomes invisible, whereas Great
Soul Dregs does most of the damage. Equip these items to boost dark sorceries:
Blindfold Mask, Scholar's Candlestick in the left hand, Court Sorcerer's
Staff+10 in the right hand, Bellowing Dragoncrest Ring, Young Dragon Ring, Dark
Clutch Ring. The following video demonstrates the above strategy.

If you have not yet reached The Dreg Heap, Gael is available to be summoned to
help you in phases 2 and 3. Gael is more useful as a means of distracting Friede
during phase 2 while you concentrate on Father Ariandel. Gael would most likely
die during this phase, but if you are lucky he would survive to phase 3 to also
help you distract Friede.
