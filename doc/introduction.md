# Introduction

The SL802 run is a challenge run as it requires you to speedrun the game
multiple times to reach the maximum soul level of 802. Of course you can use
Cheat Engine or Honest Merchant to give you all the souls necessary to level up
to SL802, but that would be like a hollow victory: you would gain precious
little from your experience and cheated yourself out of valuable lessons you
would learn from speedrunning the game. For each area and boss, it's important
to find strategies that work for you.
