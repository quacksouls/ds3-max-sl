Equip a Blessed Caestus+10 in the left hand for parrying. In your right hand,
equip these weapons: poison infused Rotten Ghru Dagger+10, Dragonslayer's
Axe+10. At the start of the fight, R1 the dagger to poison the boss. Once he is
poisoned, back away to a safe distance and use Yorshka's Chime+10 to buff your
Dragonslayer's Axe+10 with Lightning Blade. Equip the Lightning Clutch Ring and
Lloyd's Sword Ring to boost your damage output. The other 2 rings can be any of
your choosing. Most of the boss' attacks can be parried as shown in the video
guide above. Use a Caestus for reaction parry. Once parried, quickly hit with
R1, riposte with the axe, and immediately follow up with an R1. Rinse and
repeat. See the following video for the strategy.
